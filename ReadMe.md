# Procrash  
*"Crash procrastination, conquer your goals!"*  

Procrash is a gamified self-improvement app designed to help you overcome procrastination and achieve your personal goals. Inspired by popular card-based games like *Slay the Spire*, Procrash makes goal-setting and habit formation fun, interactive, and rewarding.  

## Features  
- **Gamified Goal Setting**  
  Break down your ultimate goals into manageable tasks (cards) and complete them to "damage" procrastination bosses.  
- **Boss Battles**  
  Face off against virtual "bosses" that represent procrastination. Each completed task reduces their health.  
- **Progress Tracking**  
  Track your daily and weekly progress to stay on top of your goals.  
- **Motivational Rewards**  
  Earn badges, streaks, and achievements to celebrate milestones.  
- **Personalized Notifications**  
  Get reminders to complete tasks and motivational messages to keep you going.  

## How It Works  
1. **Set Your Ultimate Goal**  
   Start by defining a big goal (e.g., "Drink 8 glasses of water daily").  
2. **Break It Down**  
   Add mini-goals (cards) like "Drink 1 glass right now" or "Do 10 pushups."  
3. **Battle Procrastination**  
   Each time you complete a task, the procrastination boss loses health.  
4. **Celebrate Your Wins**  
   Defeat bosses, earn rewards, and set new goals to keep improving!
